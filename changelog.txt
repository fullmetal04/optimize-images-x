v.0.9 beta - 2021-04-23 - First public beta
 * Easy to use GUI, completely based on Python (Tkinter/ttk).
 * Implements all the features and options currently available on Optimize
   Images (the original CLI version) for batch image optimization and file size
   reduction, including:
        - Optional recursion through subfolders
        - Conversion to grayscale
        - Image downscaling based on maximum width and/or height
        - JPEG quality (lossy compression)
        - EXIF data removal
        - PNG transparency removal, with optional background color replacement
        - PNG pallete reduction
        - PNG conversion to JPEG (all, just big images, or none, with optional
          deletion of the original PNG file)
        - ...and more.
 * Uses multiprocessing to take advantage of all available CPU cores (except the
   "watch folder" feature, since watchdog's API only seems allow threading).
 * Automatic saving of all app and task settings, including main window size and
   position.
 * Some usage statistics available on the About window.
 * All image and stats are stored and processed locally in your own computers,
   which means no need for file uploads and no worries with telemetry and other
   privacy issues.
 * Compatible with some of the most popular desktop operating systems, including
   macOS, Windows and Linux.
 * It's free (MIT License), please feel free to buy me a coffee, or to
   contribute with bug fixing or other code improvements if you'd like so.
